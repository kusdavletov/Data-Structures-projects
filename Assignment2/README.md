## Assignment 2: Binary Trees

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children called the left child and the right child. Binary trees are the most basic data structures that are widely used in all kinds of algorithms. Therefore, computer science students should learn how to implement a binary tree correctly.

In this assignment, you will implement a binary tree to store a numerical expression that consists of integer constants, variables, and operators. We call this binary tree an expression tree. The internal nodes of an expression tree are operators, while the external nodes (i.e., leaf nodes) can be either integer constants or variables.
